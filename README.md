Assignment to create a laravel app themed "car" and "response 451"

As one of the ways I was allowed to connect the assignment to the word car was through other words containing the string "car", I chose this funny little word "incarcerate", which ends up in the best possible synergy with response 451 (unavailable for legal reasons). Thus, I chose North Korea as my main inspiration, an absolute joke of a country, not only a prison but also literally censoring the entire outside world. As there is always that one person who takes everything seriously, I felt it was worth an explanation.
